# DailySquirrel

The purpose of this app is to rank images of squirrels and to upload new ones.


### Future Improvements

- Upload the images to IPFS Inter Planetary File System. IPFS Benefits: Decentralized file storage, No server costs, All images are given a unique hash, Images can potentially be loaded faster. IPFS Downsides: IPFS is only used by tech enthusiasts and not normal people, perhaps we could have a centralised database as well? Or a centralized server which fetches the images from IPFS.

Link: ipfs.io

- Add an ethereum smart contract which stores the rankings and hashes of each images as well as the votes that every person has made (each persons could be identified with their name or username).

This would make the ranking system more transparent and harder to tamper with. 

It would also show that no image is ever edited or deleted once it is put on the blockchain.

Although votes from fake persons or identity theft is still a possible problem.

- Create own ethereum token


### FAQ: 

**Q**: Why store the images on IPFS and not directly on the ethereum blockchain? 
**A**: This would be too expensive! We have to pay for each kB of data we store on ethereum.
