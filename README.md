# DailySquirrel

The purpose of this app is to rank images of squirrels and to upload new ones.


### Future Improvements

- Upload the images to IPFS Inter Planetary File System. IPFS Benefits: Decentralized file storage, No server costs, All images are given a unique hash, Images can potentially be loaded faster. Link: ipfs.io

- Add an ethereum smart contract which stores the rankings of each image together with the hash of each image

This would allow anyone to verify that no image has ever been tampered with. 

- Create own ethereum token
